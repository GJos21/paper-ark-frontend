    <p>
      Paper Ark shows a collection of objects made of paper from my personal library: Maps, Books, and Event programs. Many of these objects I inherited from my parents who loved the theater and travelled the world. My mother was an educator with a Masters degree in the classics, hence the Greek and Latin books. All of these objects were digitized by Scanarkist, a company I managed specializing in the digital preservation of paper and photographic materials.
