        Paper Ark shows a collection of objects made of paper from my personal library: Maps, Books, and Event programs. Many of these objects I inherited from my parents who loved the theater and travelled the world. My mother was an educator with a Masters degree in the classics, hence the Greek and Latin books. All of these objects were digitized by Scanarkist, a company I owned specializing in the digital preservation of paper and photographic materials.

        Most items show a cover image, and about a dozen include a complete set of page images (click the Pages checkbox to see those.) Google Books provides additional details for any items with ISBN numbers.
